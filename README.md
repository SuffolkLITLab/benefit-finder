# Public Benefits Finder How-To
<p> 1)	First, you must familiarize yourself with the platforms used to create the Public Benefits Finder: QnA Markup and GitHub. QnA Markup is the markup language used to create the interactive questionnaires. It is user-friendly and displays the questionnaire similar to an iMessage conversation. And we hosted the questionnaires with GitHub, which is open-source. I recommend you use the following resources on the platforms’ respective websites:
a)	QnA Markup: https://www.qnamarkup.org/syntax/
b)	GitHub: https://help.github.com/ </P>
2)	Once you familiarize yourself with QnA Markup and GitHub, you must request access to the GitHub repository where all the Public Benefits Finder documents are stored.
a)	Create a GitHub account at https://github.com/join/.
b)	Request access to the GitHub repository from Professor Colarusso.
c)	You should see the following on your computer screen: 
d)	The “Public Benefits Finder Documents” folder contains a backup of our work on the project including, but not limited to, QnA files, research, and the 2018 Clinnovation Presentation. 
e)	The additional .txt files (e.g. SNAPQNA.txt) and their corresponding .html (SNAPQNA.html) files are the live questionnaires.
f)	The JavaScript file (script.js) is referenced in the Public Benefits Finder for calculations in regard to the Federal Poverty Guidelines. 
g)	Here is where you upload new benefit QnA Markups and edit the “IntroBenefitsQNA” (https://aambrogio.github.io/LIT-QNAs/IntroBenefitsQNA.html) so users can access all benefit questionnaires from a central hub.
