# Public Benefits Finder How-To
1)	First, you must familiarize yourself with the platforms used to create the Public Benefits Finder: QnA Markup and GitHub. QnA Markup is the markup language used to create the interactive questionnaires. It is user-friendly and displays the questionnaire similar to an iMessage conversation. And we hosted the questionnaires with GitHub, which is open-source. I recommend you use the following resources on the platformsâ€™ respective websites:
a)	QnA Markup: https://www.qnamarkup.org/syntax/
b)	GitHub: https://help.github.com/
